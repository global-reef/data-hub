# Global Reef Open Data Repository

Welcome to the open-access data hub for **Global Reef**, a marine research and conservation organization based in Thailand. This repository hosts curated, version-controlled datasets used in our field studies, monitoring programs, and ecological assessments.

## 🔍 Purpose

This repository provides structured access to key datasets used in ongoing and published research projects. All files are updated automatically from internal Google Sheets and made available to researchers, managers, students, and the public.

The live data portal is accessible at:  
👉 [https://global-reef.github.io/data-hub](https://global-reef.github.io/data-hub)

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each folder contains a group of related datasets:

- `Artificial_Reef_Research/`
- `COTS_Research/` (Crown-of-Thorns Starfish)
- `Timed_Fish_Surveys/`
- *(additional folders coming soon)*

Each `.csv` file is synced directly from Global Reef's internal records and reflects the most recent available data.
